            Nate Silver and his FiveThirtyEight publication have together been one of the most important and intriguing stories of the new media world order. A UChicago economics B.A. breaks out from coding statistical measurements for a subscription baseball site when he anoymously starts calling the outcomes of the bruising 2008 primaries better than anyone. He’s <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeight-to-partner-with-new/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeight-to-partner-with-new/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">hired by America’s paper of record</a> two years later and becomes a bona fide icon, as well as a lightning rod for criticism. Present here are themes of data’s importance in politics and journalism, media personalities developing powerful individual brands, and the general role of the Internet in society&#8202;—&#8202;and Silver is personally responsible for many of these changes.</p>
          <p>
            The Internet is littered with <a target="_blank" href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com" data-href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">flash-in-the-pan bloggers</a>, but Silver’s story didn’t end in 2008, or even after perfectly forecasting the electoral map at the New York Times in 2012. Instead, the stakes became perhaps even higher in July of last year, when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2013/07/nate-silver-renowned-statistician-author-and-founder-of-fivethirtyeight-joins-espn-in-multi-faceted-role/" data-href="http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2013/07/nate-silver-renowned-statistician-author-and-founder-of-fivethirtyeight-joins-espn-in-multi-faceted-role/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">ESPN announced they had hired Silver</a>. FiveThirtyEight relaunched at its old URL in March with a <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">widely-discussed 3500-word “manifesto;”</a> it retains a coveted link above-the-scroll on ESPN.com.</p>
          <p>
            Given the journalistic philosophy Silver has partially inspired, this year’s proliferation of new journalism ventures taking lessons from him is surprising only in its rapidity. One of the most prominent, Vox, is a collaboration between Vox Media, publisher of SB Nation and others, and another refugee from a national American newspaper, this time wunderkind Ezra Klein formerly of the Washington Post. I’ve been reading Vox a lot because it quickly employed two of my favorite writers, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias" data-href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Matthew Yglesias</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tvoti" data-href="https://twitter.com/tvoti" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Todd VanDerWerff</a>, but organizations like <a target="_blank" href="https://firstlook.org" data-href="https://firstlook.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">First Look Media</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themarshallproject.org" data-href="https://www.themarshallproject.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">The Marshall Project</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozy.com" data-href="http://www.ozy.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Ozy</a> also owe Silver a debt in one way or another.</p>

          <p>
            In this vein the Times started a new semi-standalone brand, The Upshot, edited by Pulitzer Prize winner David Leonhardt. The Upshot follows great acrimony between Silver and some of the Times’ newsroom, which has played out <a target="_blank" href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/nate-silver-went-against-the-grain-for-some-at-the-times" data-href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/nate-silver-went-against-the-grain-for-some-at-the-times" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">only partially behind the scenes</a>. Paul Krugman extensively criticized the new FiveThirtyEight after its launch on his blog at the Times; Silver collected some of those criticisms in <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/for-columnist-a-change-of-tone/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/for-columnist-a-change-of-tone/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">a post that can really only be described as douchey</a>.</p>
          <p>
            The back-and-forth springs from Silver’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/playbook/1212/playbook9656.html" data-href="http://www.politico.com/playbook/1212/playbook9656.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">highly publicized perspective</a> that “punditry is fundamentally useless.” In his manifesto and elsewhere, Silver has discussed his disdain for the media’s political coverage and its non-rigorous nature. Peggy Noonan, he wrote, shouldn’t have predicted a Romney victory based on yard signs, and Mark Halperin and John Heilemann should’ve paid more attention to polling causality in their 2013 book Double Down. Criticism of political journalism as transitory and empty is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/opinion/a-conversation-in-lieu-of-a-column.html" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/opinion/a-conversation-in-lieu-of-a-column.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">widespread</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/d80_hamby.pdf" data-href="http://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/d80_hamby.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">well-founded</a>, although I probably hate it less than Silver.</p>

          <p>
            So the Times and FiveThirtyEight are sometimes directly competing, and nowhere is that more apparent than in their articles on the College Football Playoff. In addition to spawning the worst Dr Pepper commercials ever, the CFP has done anything but its intended purpose of ending the controversy over crowning an undisputed national champion. Unique among American sports with its stature, Division I college football has never had a proper postseason. This season, for the first time, a committee of 12 will choose four teams to play in a two-round knockout bracket, with the winner given a <a target="_blank" href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11213662/college-football-playoff-trophy-unveiled" data-href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11213662/college-football-playoff-trophy-unveiled" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">shiny new trophy</a>. It’ll look great in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/25293939@N02/3232619035/" data-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/25293939@N02/3232619035/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall in Athens</a> in January.</p>
          <p>
            Since 2004, a formula of two human polls and six computer ratings spit out the top 25 teams in the country every week, and the top two played a national championship game. With considerable uncertainty over <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff#Selection_committee" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff#Selection_committee" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">how eleven men and Condoleezza Rice</a> will choose the top four teams, the sports media complex has been given oceans of proverbial ink to spill since the season began. The Upshot and FiveThirtyEight have both joined the discussion.</p>
          <p>
            <a id="871d"></a>Silver yesterday wrote about <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-college-football-playoff-forecast/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-college-football-playoff-forecast/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">his site’s new model</a>, which appears to equate a finish in one of top four slots in the long-established Coaches’ Poll with a playoff berth. This is a reasonable way to establish a forecast for this otherwise unprecedented event, and Silver’s model projects Alabama, Oregon, and Florida State as the three teams with greater-than-50-percent probability of reaching the playoff. The Dawgs have a 7.7 percent chance of getting in and a 2 percent chance of winning it all, which I’ll take.</p>

          <p>
            And I would be ecstatic about all of this, if the Upshot hadn’t released <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/15/upshot/college-football-playoff-ranking-scenarios.html" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/15/upshot/college-football-playoff-ranking-scenarios.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">its analysis of CFP odds last week</a>. Relying only on two hard numbers&#8202;—&#8202;the wins and losses&#8202;—&#8202;for each team, it divides college football into twelve “types of teams” based on their conferences and records. In doing so, the Upshot says the Crimson Tide, Ducks, Seminoles, and Mississippi State Bulldogs “probably control their fate” and would earn the four berths by winning their remaining games. Teams like Georgia fall into the “need help” segment, and wouldn’t make the playoff unless teams ahead of them start to lose. I love this article so much that I’ve already posted on Facebook saying the Times deserves a Pulitzer for it.</p>
          <p>
            <a id="746a"></a>Since they focus on the same topic, these two pieces provide an instructive point for comparison between FiveThirtyEight and the Upshot. Silver’s post gets points for doing the actual math, which more than anything else gives a bottom-line forecast for people to look at and argue over rather than just another random sports opinion. But I liked the Upshot piece more, not least because it’s just a lot better read unless I’m only coming for the numbers. I’m struck that Silver is not writing this post for actual college football fans, particularly when he writes sentences like “if you look carefully at the chart, you’ll see that USC’s probability distribution is bimodal.” Rather, I think Silver’s ideal audience isn’t the sports fan but the football-agnostic statistics fan. Plus, what’s up with the crazy first two charts? I get trying to condense a lot of data into the most concise format, but these are just super unintuitive.</p>
          <p>
            The two publications also aligned during the midterm elections, when both the Upshot and FiveThirtyEight issued Senate forecasts. With a runoff in Louisiana still outstanding, <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/senate-forecast/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/senate-forecast/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">FiveThirtyEight only missed the Kansas race</a>, which it had called the closest in the country, while the Upshot scored perfectly. But accuracy aside, the Upshot posted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/index.html" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/index.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">an absolutely beautiful interactive graphic with reams and reams and reams of information</a>, including many other Senate forecasts. On election night, though, the Upshot really shone. Visit FiveThirtyEight for your election coverage, and you get a live blog. Visit the New York Times, and you enjoy all the benefits of a major national news organization, plus an amazing “<a target="_blank" href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/senate-model" data-href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/senate-model" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">live Senate model</a>.” That last one didn’t work perfectly&#8202;—&#8202;them’s the breaks for debuting a major stat-cruncher in real time, I suppose&#8202;—&#8202;but for the key Virginia race, the live model was like having <a target="_blank" href="http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/utp2l5/cnn-s-magic-wall-conspiracy-thriller" data-href="http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/utp2l5/cnn-s-magic-wall-conspiracy-thriller" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">John King and his Magic Wall</a> in your living room.</p>

          <p>
            I don’t feel comfortable making an outright claim that the Upshot is better than FiveThirtyEight since I haven’t read all that much of the latter. But that in itself says something about Silver’s site, I think. Other than the Senate forecast, several associated elections pieces, and World Cup coverage, I could only think of a couple articles I’ve read on the new FiveThirtyEight so far. I read one <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/predicting-when-game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-will-come-out-with-his-next-book/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/predicting-when-game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-will-come-out-with-his-next-book/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">estimating when the next “Game of Thrones” book would come out</a>, which seemed to be largely a joke, or at least “an exercise in the limits of statistical analysis.” Then there was <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">an analysis of the old PBS “Joy of Painting” show</a>, but I didn’t quite see the point of learning that exactly 53 percent of the paintings included coniferous trees.</p>
          <p>
            <a id="c6d9"></a>My thoughts on the matter are going to be biased, of course. I’m a huge New York Times homer, for one, and when David Brooks is discussing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/david-brooks-death-by-data.html" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/david-brooks-death-by-data.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">the limits of data in political thought</a>, I’m usually going to agree with the guy who signed a book I own. And while I’m probably more supportive of data analysis than, say, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/11/01/dick-morris-romney-will-win-landslide/" data-href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/11/01/dick-morris-romney-will-win-landslide/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Dick Morris</a>, my humanities inclination means I’m <a target="_blank" href="http://sportsviz.blogspot.com/2014/03/oscars-prediction-reboot-part-v.html" data-href="http://sportsviz.blogspot.com/2014/03/oscars-prediction-reboot-part-v.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">not quite the statistician my friends are</a>. Nate Silver is still a nerd god, and <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-were-skewed-toward-democrats/" data-href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-were-skewed-toward-democrats/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">with polls proving to have been incorrect across the board in 2014</a> his authority remains crucial.</p>
          <p>
            But while it’s also difficult for me to point out Upshot articles I’ve read, that’s because I’m just thinking of them as Times articles, which I read voraciously. Election night shows the organizations in miniature, as the Upshot is folded into the wider world of the Times’ pace-setting journalism. At the Upshot, numbers are used to tell these rich stories. Too often in year one of FiveThirtyEight, the numbers are the story.</p>
